# GameDevProject
Platformer game inspired by Super Mario Sunshine. Group project for Game Dev class

#### TODO for 50% Submission: 
1. On Sliding Cubes prefab - make it so cubes properly transform/move on the platform
2. Disappearing Cubes - make them change in alpha over time. Probably use some kind of lerping
3. Create new prefab - floating sliding/transitioning rectangles. MAKE SURE the character doesn't slide off, they'll need some kind of friction
4. ~~End of level item - need an item that denotes Victory for the level. Golden floppy disk.  Displays "Victory!" on your screen~~



#### TODO for Final Submission:
1. Level designs - 20 levels total, every 5 levels has its own theme.
	- Overall theme is Computer landscape. Inspiration: 
		- Code Lyoko
		- Tron
2. Menus - starting menu
3. Portal room for selecting level. Portals turn on as levels are unlocked. 
4. On death - decrement lives count. When lives = 0, screen goes to black and says "Game Over!"
5. On grabbing golden floppy disk, gives you a cat picture. 20 cat pictures total.
